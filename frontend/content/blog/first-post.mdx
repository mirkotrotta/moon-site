# Welcome to MDX

This blog is powered by **Next.js 14** and `next-mdx-remote` ðŸ’ª  
Here you can write markdown and embed React components too.

## Images in MDX

You can now include images in your blog posts like this:

![An example image showing nature](https://picsum.photos/seed/example1/800/400)

Or you can use the HTML syntax for more control:

<Image src="https://picsum.photos/seed/example2/800/400" alt="Another beautiful example image" />

## More content

You can add any markdown content and it will be properly rendered and optimized:

- List item 1
- List item 2
- List item 3

> This is a blockquote with some important information

```js
// This is a code block
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, MDX!");
}
```
