# Working with Images in MDX

This post demonstrates all the ways you can include and optimize images in your MDX blog posts.

## Cover Images

Each blog post can now include a cover image by adding the `coverImage` property to the frontmatter:

```md
---
title: "My Blog Post"
date: "2025-04-08"
coverImage: "https://example.com/my-image.jpg"
---
```

The cover image will automatically be displayed at the top of your post and in the blog index page. It will also be included in the OpenGraph and Twitter metadata for better social media sharing.

## Standard Markdown Images

You can use the standard Markdown syntax for images:

![A beautiful landscape image](https://picsum.photos/seed/landscape/800/400)

This uses the format: `![Alt text](URL)`

## HTML Image Tags in MDX

You can also use HTML image tags directly in your MDX:

<Image src="https://picsum.photos/seed/html-image/800/400" alt="Image using HTML tag" />

## Image Styling

All images are automatically:

1. Responsive - they adjust to the screen size
2. Optimized - they load quickly and efficiently
3. Styled - they get rounded corners and proper spacing

## Captions

Images with alt text will automatically display that text as a caption below the image.

![This text will appear as a caption below the image](https://picsum.photos/seed/caption/800/400)

## Placeholder Images

If you don't specify a cover image, a placeholder will be automatically generated based on your post's slug:

```md
// This will use https://picsum.photos/seed/[slug]/800/400
```

## Tips for Using Images

- Use descriptive alt text for accessibility
- Choose appropriate image dimensions (recommended: 800x400 for cover images)
- Optimize your images before uploading for better performance
- Consider the context where the image will appear

## Example Gallery

Here are some more examples of images to showcase the styling:
