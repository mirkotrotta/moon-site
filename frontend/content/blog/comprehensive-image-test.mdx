# Complete Image Test Suite

This post tests all possible scenarios for image rendering to ensure our fixes work correctly.

## 1. Standard Images

A simple image with alt text:

![Standard image with alt text](https://picsum.photos/seed/standard/800/400)

## 2. Consecutive Images

Two images directly following each other:

![First consecutive image](https://picsum.photos/seed/consecutive1/800/400)

![Second consecutive image](https://picsum.photos/seed/consecutive2/800/400)

## 3. Inline Images

This paragraph has an ![inline image](https://picsum.photos/seed/inline/200/100) right in the middle of the text flow.

## 4. Images with HTML Markup

<Image src="https://picsum.photos/seed/html/800/400" alt="Image using HTML markup" />

## 5. Images in Lists

- Regular list item
- List item with an ![image in list](https://picsum.photos/seed/list/200/100)
- Another regular list item

## 6. Nested Structure
